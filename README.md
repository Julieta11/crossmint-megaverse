# Megaverse Creation Challenge Solution

Welcome to my solution for the Crossmint coding challenge. I've crafted a unique Megaverse-- a 2D space teeming with celestial wonders like ü™êPOLYanets, üåôSOLoons, and ‚òÑcomETHs.

## Getting Started

To dive into the Megaverse creation process, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the cloned repository directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up Docker Environment:
Set up the Docker environment for containerized execution. Ensure Docker is installed on your machine and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
make build
```

4. Set Up Environment Variables:
Ensure you have set up the required env variables. Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following configs:

```
BASE_URL=http://localhost
PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info
CROSSMINT_API_URL=https://challenge.crossmint.io/api/
CANDIDATE_ID=ce0172cc-2b78-46bc-8142-41085e2191d8
```

5. Execute Megaverse Creation:
Once the Docker image is successfully built, execute the Megaverse creation process by running:

```bash
make run
```

## API Endpoints
Once the Megaverse is up and running, you can interact with the following API endpoints:

Create Megaverse:
```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/createMegaverse'
```

Empty Megaverse:
```
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:3000/api/emptyMegaverse'
```

These endpoints allow you to perform specific actions within the Megaverse environment. Make sure to use the appropriate HTTP methods when interacting with each endpoint.

## Folder Structure

The repository follows a structured layout for better organization:

- **src**: Contains the source code.
  - **interfaces**: Holds API and utility interfaces.
  - **utils**: Holds utility functions for Megaverse creation.
  - **controllers**: Holds the router and the correspongin handler functions.
  - **middlewares**: Contains the erroHandler logic.
  - **services**: Holds the whole create a megaverse process.
  - **index.ts**: Entry point for the Megaverse creation.
- **test**: Includes automated tests for validation.

## Dependencies

Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the solution:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): JavaScript runtime for executing scripts.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): Node.js package manager for installing dependencies.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Containerization platform for consistent execution.
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): Build automation tool for simplified execution.

## Testing

Run tests using `make test`.
